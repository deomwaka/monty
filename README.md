# Monty Interpreter

A language interpreter made in the C programming language to manage stacks and queues (LIFO and FIFO). The aim is to interpret Monty bytecodes files. [Monty](http://montyscoconut.github.io/) is a language that aims to close the gap between scripting and programming languages.

## Allowable opcodes and what they do

|opcode  |  functionality|
| --- | --- |
| push | add element to the 'top' of stack and 'end' of queue  |
| pop  | remove element from 'top' of stack and 'end' of queue |
|pall  |print every member of the structure|
| pint | prints the member value at the top of stack |
| swap | swaps the order  of the 1st and 2nd elements in stack |
| add | add top two member values |
| sub | subtract the top element from the 2nd top element |
| div | divide the 2nd element by the top element |
| mul | multiply the top two elements of the stack |
| mod | the remainder when the 2nd element is divided by the top element |
| comment | there is the ability to parse comments found in bytecode ->'#'|
| pchar | print character at the top of the stack |
| pstr | print the character at the top of the stack|
| rotl | moves element at the top to the bottom of the stack |
| rotr | the bottom of the stack becomes the top |
| queue, stack | toggles the doubly link list implementation style |
| nop | opcode should do nothing |
